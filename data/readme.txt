The first dataset we used is made by Veltri et al. (2018) [23], 
containing 1778 AMPs constructed from the APD vr.3 database [37] and 1778 non-AMPs constructed from UniPort [38]. 
The dataset is split by Veltri et al. (2018) [23] into a training set, a tuning set and a test set,
the number of AMP sequences are 712, 354, and 712 respectively. 
More detailed information of this dataset can be found in Veltri et al. (2018) [23]. In the rest
of the paper, this dataset is named DAMP dataset. 
The second dataset is taken from AntiBP2 [10], which has 1998 peptide sequences. AMPs have âˆ¼75% overlap with DAMP dataset and non-AMPs have no overlap with it. The third dataset is an anti-inflammatory (AIP) dataset, which is from AIPpred [36]. This dataset contains 1258 AIPs and 1887 non-AIPs in training set, 420 AIPs and 629 non-AIPs in test set. The last dataset is from the paper [15], which is composed of 10278 sequences. Table 1 summarizes the four datasets
