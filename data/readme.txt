The first dataset we used is made by Veltri et al. (2018) [23], 
containing 1778 AMPs constructed from the APD vr.3 database [37] and 1778 non-AMPs constructed from UniPort [38]. 
The dataset is split by Veltri et al. (2018) [23] into a training set AMP.tr.fa(true)DECOY.tr.fa(false), a tuning set AMP.eval.fa(true)DECOY.eval.fa(false) and a test set AMP.te.fa(true)DECOY.te.fa(false),
the number of AMP sequences are 712, 354, and 712 respectively. 
More detailed information of this dataset can be found in Veltri et al. (2018) [23]. 
another dataset is an anti-inflammatory (AIP) dataset, which is from AIPpred [36]. This dataset in in the folder AIP. This dataset contains 1258 AIPs and 1887 non-AIPs in training set, 420 AIPs and 629 non-AIPs in test set.
